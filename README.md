there was no duplaications.
the missing value removal was not performed since the only missing values were on section column and removing them was affecting the records.
outliers were not removed because they show real-life important data that affects the footprint.
i have dropped the rows between 30 and 160 because the information in the first table was already in the second table.
created new columns because i have deleted them in 4.
data types in 2013 and 2014  were changed from object to float since they are decimals. 
i recalculated the total of annual emissions to make sure they were correctly calculated since the whole project is all about them.
the data frame that was created for model implementation had its own data cleaning like dtype.
in decision tree regressor there was overfitting.
